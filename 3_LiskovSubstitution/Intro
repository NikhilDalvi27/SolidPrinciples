1)Liskov Substitution
- Objects should be replaceable with their subtypes
  without affecting the correctness of the program

It wants us to move away from 'is A' way of thinking


eg:  Inheritance -> 'is A' Relationship
    1)Hatchback is a car
    2)Gasoline is a fuel
    3)Ostrich is a Bird

    Here in the third example the Ostrich cannot fly
    When Ostrich extends bird it overrides the fly method
    and keeps the fly method unimplemented -- this is a Design Flaw

1)Breaking the Heirarchy
2)Tell Don't Ask
