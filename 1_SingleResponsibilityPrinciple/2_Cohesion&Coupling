1)SingleResponsibility_Cohesion
-It is the degree to which various parts of Software component are related
 (Doing similar task)
eg: Segregated Waste    - has high cohesion
    Unsegregated Waste  - has low cohesion
HIGH COHESION is desirable


2)SingleResponsibility_Coupling
-It is the level of interdependency between various Software Components
eg: Width of tracks
    -Standard Guage Rail -- 1.4m wide
    -Broad Gauge Rail -- 1.6m wide
    This difference demands for 2 entirely different railway systems
    -SO A TRAIN IS TIGHTLY COUPLED TO ITS TRACK
LOOSE COUPLING is desirable
