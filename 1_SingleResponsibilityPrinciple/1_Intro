SOLID
S-Single Responsibility


For Refactoring a Class -- Figure Out the Number of Reasons for it to Change

Definition 1
-Every Software Component Should have One and Only One Responsibility
-Component can be a Class, Method or Module

Definition 2
-Every Software Component Should have One and Only One Reason to change
(Because Number of Bugs increases with the increase in the Frequency Of Change)
(If the Changes are related to One Other you can combine them)


eg: Swiss Army Knife violates this Principle since it has multiple Functionality
    (eg: It has can opener,scissors,screw driver,knife)
