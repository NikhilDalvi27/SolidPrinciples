eg: An Insurance company which is primarily Health Insurance
    may later provide Vehicle and Home Insurance
    The method for calculating discount for loyal customer
    should be open for Modification in such cases


OpenClose Provides
1)Ease of adding new Features
  -Translate to cost saving bcoz if OpenClose is not followed then to add
   a new functionality we will have to modify the existing code
   More number of changes -> More time on QA and Testing
  -If Open Close is followed only the new code needs to be tested and
   not the existing code
2) Leads to minimal cost of developing and testing new feature
3)Open Closed requires DECOUPLING which in turn automatically follows the
  Single Responsibility Principle


Caution
1) Do not follow Open Close principle blindly - will endup with huge number
   of classes that can complicate your overall design
2) Do only when revamping design fixes certain kind of bug
