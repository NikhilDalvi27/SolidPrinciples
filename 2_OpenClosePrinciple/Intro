1)Open-Close Principle
-Software Components should be
  Closed for Modification  &
  Open for Extension


For eg- In Nintendo
    1)For Using the gun we just place the remote controller in the gun
    2)For using the Steering Wheel just place the remote controller in the wheel
    For the GUN and WHEEL functionality we did not do any changes to the CPU
    So the CPU is closed for modification
    but Open for adding on new accessories(Extension)


1)Closed For Modification
-New Features getting added to the Software component,
 should not have to modify the existing Code

2)Open for Extension
-A Software component should be extendable
 to add a new feature or add a new behaviour to it
